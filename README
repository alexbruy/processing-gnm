Geographic Network Model (GNM) is a set of GDAL classes and tools for
creating, managing and analysing networks built over spatial data.

Processing is a geoprocessing environment that can be used to call native and
third party algorithms from QGIS, making your spatial analysis tasks more
productive and easy to accomplish.

This plugin implements GDAL GNM provider for QGIS Processing framework.
Requires QGIS >= 3.0

NOTE: to use this plugin you need GDAL >= 2.1 build with GNM support and
corresponing Python bindings.
