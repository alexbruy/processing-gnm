GNM for Processing
------------------
Geographic Network Model (GNM) is a set of GDAL classes and tools for
creating, managing and analysing networks built over spatial data.

Processing (former SEXTANTE) is a geoprocessing environment that can be
used to call native and third party algorithms from QGIS, making your
spatial analysis tasks more productive and easy to accomplish.

This plugin implements GNM provider for QGIS Processing framework.

NOTE: to use this plugin you need GDAL >= 2.1 build with GNM support.
